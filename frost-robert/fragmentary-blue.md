Fragmentary Blue
-------------------------

Why make so much of fragmentary blue  
In here and there a bird, or butterfly,  
Or flower, or wearing-stone, or open eye,  
When heaven presents in sheets the solid hue?
 
Since earth is earth, perhaps, not heaven (as yet) â€”  
Though some savants make earth include the sky;  
And blue so far above us comes so high,  
It only gives our wish for blue a whet.
