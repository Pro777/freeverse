# Stylebook

## Formatting Poetry

 1. Include spaces (not tabs) for indentations. It should look correct in a text editor, even if Markdown does not respect these spaces (yet).
 2. Remember that Markdown requires two spaces at the end of a line to see a line break.
 3. Currently avoiding curly quotation marks and apostrophes, but open to reversing that.

## Poets and Poetry Selection

 1. Only use poems in the public domain, or otherwise licensed to allow publication without restrictions beyond attribution.
 2. Strive to find two or more sources for a given poem, and compare them. Many online sources are unreliable, but places like the Poetry Foundation, Bartleby, and sites dedicated to a given poet will tend to have better consistency regarding spacing and spelling (and, sometimes, variants).

### Biographies

 1. Either write an original biography or include none. (There's always Wikipedia.)
