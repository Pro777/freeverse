The Windhover
-------------

   *To Christ our Lord*

I caught this morning morning's minion, king-  
    dom of daylight's dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding  
    Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding  
High there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing  
In his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing,  
    As a skate's heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding  
    Rebuffed the big wind. My heart in hiding  
Stirred for a bird, — the achieve of, the mastery of the thing!

Brute beauty and valour and act, oh, air, pride, plume, here  
    Buckle! AND the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion  
Times told lovelier, more dangerous, O my chevalier!
     
   No wonder of it: shéer plód makes plough down sillion  
Shine, and blue-bleak embers, ah my dear,  
    Fall, gall themselves, and gash gold-vermilion.
