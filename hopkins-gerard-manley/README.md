# Gerard Manley (G.M.) Hopkins

Now famous, Fr. Hopkins was almost entirely unknown in his own lifetime. He writes with a stylistic freedom that seems to have baffled his Victorian contemporaries, the sterling example of which is his invention and use of [sprung rhythm](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/learn/glossary-terms/sprung-rhythm) (in short: basing rhythm on stresses, and not strictly counting unstressed syllables, in order to approximate speech, folk song, and the like).

His work is largely religious (Hopkins being a Catholic convert and a Jesuit), quasi-Romantic regarding nature, layered in meaning, and compact. Even his long work, *The Wreck of the Deutschland*, has characteristically packed-in lines. He also uses Welsh at times, though woven into his otherwise English poetry.

He was born in 1844, and died in 1889. He would have escaped the world's notice if not for his friend and fellow poet Robert Bridges, who published Hopkins's work thirty years after his early death.

Note: Some of his poems do not have titles, and are known by their first line or first few words. The more colloquial titles (phrases, as opposed to the whole first line, which is a scholarly tic) are used here.
